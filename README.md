# Hotel-Management-System(Sapphire Skies)
## Project Overview:
The Hotel Management System is a Management Information System (MIS) developed using Java and MySQL for managing various hotel operations. The system facilitates customer registration, room management, employee details, and more. It aims to streamline hotel management activities, ensuring efficiency and smooth operations.

This system is built with a Java Swing interface for user interaction and a MySQL database for data storage. The system is designed to help with tasks such as managing customer information, room availability, employee details, and tracking bookings.

## Key Features:
- **Customer Registration:** Allows the addition and management of customer details.
- **Employee Information:** Manages details of hotel employees.
- **Room Management:** Displays room availability, adds or removes rooms, and tracks room cleanliness.
- **Booking Management:** Tracks customer bookings, check-ins, and check-outs.
- **User Interface:** Developed with Java Swing for a user-friendly graphical interface.
- **Login System:** Secure login for users using username and password.
- **Data Storage:** Uses MySQL to store customer, room, employee, and booking data.
- **Dashboard:** A simple and easy-to-navigate dashboard for hotel management tasks.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java:** Core programming language for the system's logic.
- **Java Swing:** Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **MySQL:** Database used for storing hotel data (customers, rooms, employees, bookings, etc.).
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** To connect the Java application with the MySQL database.

## How It Works:
- **Customer Registration:** Enter customer details like name, contact, and ID for registration. This information is stored in the database.
- **Room Management:** Admin can add/remove rooms and view the availability and cleanliness status of each room.
- **Booking Management:** Admin can book rooms, check-in, and check-out customers.
- **Employee Management:** View and manage employee details and assign them relevant tasks.

## Project Development Process:
- Developed the system using object-oriented programming principles in Java.
- Designed and implemented a relational database schema to manage customer, room, employee, and booking data.
- Integrated Java Swing components to create a functional and user-friendly graphical interface.
- Ensured smooth user experience by optimizing the flow of operations.

## Conclusion:
The Hotel Management System simplifies hotel operations by automating customer registration, room management, bookings, and more. The system is fully functional and designed to meet the needs of small to medium-sized hotels. It serves as a practical example of software development skills, covering both front-end and back-end development.
